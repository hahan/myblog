<div>Selecting a string randomly from a file: (using O(1) space and reading file only once)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Open the file and save the first string. At this point you have&nbsp;one candidate string with a 100% probability of picking it. While remembering the first string, read the next string. You now have two candidates, each with a 50% probability. Pick one of them,&nbsp;save it, and discard the other. Read the next string, and choose between that and the saved string,&nbsp;weighting your choice 33% toward the new string and 67% toward the survivor (which represents the&nbsp;winner of the previous two-way selection). Save the new survivor.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Keep on doing this throughout the entire file, at each step reading string N, and choosing between that&nbsp;(with probability 1/N) and the previous survivor, with probability (N - 1)/N.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>When you reach the end&nbsp;of the file, the current survivor is the string picked at random!</div>
