<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last one year, I have been looking towards learning some of the core principles and ideas behind designing and implementing distributed systems. Even though at Amazon, almost every service that I have worked on is designed to be distributed, it is built more over other building blocks like DynamoDb, SWF etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to go little deeper into these building blocks, work and learn about a core distributed system. I have found some great posts, books and systems that I intend to read and learn about. I want to compile them here in this post and will keep on updating as I find more interesting stuff.</p>
