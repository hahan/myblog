I have recently started using [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) for anything and everything I do at home and office. I now definitely see the difference between a day with adhoc and some (yes, you missed the word recently at the start of the post) planning.

I would recommend to go buy [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360770797&sr=8-1&keywords=Getting+Things+Done%3A+The+Art+of+Stress-Free+Productivity) by __David Allen__, and of course read it. But just in case, you are like me who wants to get a quick summary of what to expect in a book before buying, see this [excellent blog](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/getting-started-with-getting-things-done) and specially [this document](http://articles.jbrains.ca/GettingStartedWithGettingThingsDone.pdf) that should take your 5 minutes to get the feel of GTD.


This is just a starter, I will post my own setup of GTD with all the apps and process that I use personally, may be something later this month.
