Over the last one year, I have been looking towards learning some of the core principles and ideas behind designing and implementing distributed systems. Even though at Amazon, almost every service that I have worked on is designed to be distributed, it is built more over other building blocks like DynamoDb, SWF etc.

My goal is to go little deeper into these building blocks, work and learn about a core distributed system. I have found some great posts, books and systems that I intend to read and learn about. I want to compile them here in this post and will keep on updating as I find more interesting stuff.
