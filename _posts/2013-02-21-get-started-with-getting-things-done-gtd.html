<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I have recently started using </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" style="font-family: inherit;">GTD</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> for anything and everything I do at home and office. I now definitely see the difference between a day with adhoc and some (yes, you missed the word recently at the start of the post) planning.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I would recommend to go buy </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360770797&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Getting+Things+Done%3A+The+Art+of+Stress-Free+Productivity" style="font-family: inherit;">this book</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> by David Allen, and of course read it. But just in case, you are like me who wants to get a quick summary of what to expect in a book before buying, see this </span><a href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/getting-started-with-getting-things-done" style="font-family: inherit;">excellent blog</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> and specially </span><a href="http://articles.jbrains.ca/GettingStartedWithGettingThingsDone.pdf" style="font-family: inherit;">this document</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> that should take your 5  minutes to get the feel of GTD.</span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is just a starter, I will post <a href="http://hakimhanif.blogspot.com/2013/07/get-things-done-my-setup.html" target="_blank">my own setup of GTD</a> with all the apps and process that I use personally, may be something later this month.</span></span></div>
