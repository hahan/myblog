Here are some of the engineering blogs from a number of tech companies that I follow.

* [Airbnb](http://nerds.airbnb.com)
* [Coursera Tech](https://tech.coursera.org/)
* [DropBox Tech Blog](https://tech.dropbox.com/)
* [Facebook Engineering](https://code.facebook.com/posts/)
* [FourSquare Engineering](http://engineering.foursquare.com/)
* [Instagram Engineering](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/)
* [LinkedIn Engineering](http://engineering.linkedin.com/blog)
* [Netflix Tech blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/)
* [Prismatic](http://blog.getprismatic.com/)
* [Tumblr Engineering](http://engineering.tumblr.com/)
* [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering)
* [Yahoo](http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/)

All the above are really interesting to read but my favorite is the Netflix blog as it not only talks about all kind of distributed problems that they are solving but most of times their code is open source so you can actually see the implementation details.

I will keep on updating this blog as I get more such interesting blogs to read.
