<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">I came across this awesome talk from 25 year old Indian filmmaker, Varun Agarwal talking about his mantra of success - Don't think, just do it. It does resonate with similar ideas from so many other successful entrepreneurs, but I really like the way he has presented his thoughts in this talk.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
