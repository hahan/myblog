<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Just for fun :)&nbsp;<a href="http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html">http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html</a></p>
<p>My favorite quotes:</p>
<p><i>"Whenever two programmers meet to criticize their programs, both are silent."</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>"Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written and another for which it wasn't."</i></div>
