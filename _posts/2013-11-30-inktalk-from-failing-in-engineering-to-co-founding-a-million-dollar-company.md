I came across this awesome talk from 25 year old Indian filmmaker, Varun Agarwal talking about his mantra of success - Don't think, just do it. It does resonate with similar ideas from so many other successful entrepreneurs, but I really like the way he has presented his thoughts in this talk.

Enjoy!
