<p style="text-align: justify;">I just finished my first book of the year 2015: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X" target="_blank"><strong>The Power of Habit</strong></a> by Charles Duhigg. It's an amazing book if you are looking to learn</p>
<ul>
<li>How to change or create new habits?</li>
<li>Why you don’t follow the routines like going to gym though you really want to go?</li>
<li>Why will you give up your resolutions to not to eat that sugar wrapped calorie behemoth cookie even though you know its not good for you?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In short, the science and research behind how human mind and tendencies work on creating a routine and following their habits. The book won’t give you the one answer that you are looking for but instead leave you with a framework to follow if you do want to change your habits. Now, how sincerely you follow it, its up to you. In other words, you have to create a habit to follow the framework of creating a new habit. As simple as that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it has some awesome stories from how you shop at target to what Starbucks do to make sure you drink their $4 expensive coffee without thinking twice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A must read.</p>
